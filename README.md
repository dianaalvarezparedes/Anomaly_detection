# Anomaly detection
This code allows to determine anomaly detection of transmission kpis related to base stations

# General Objetive

Develop an automatic anomaly detection and diagnosis framework for mobile networks, through the analysis of the transmission KPIs obtained from an OSS system, in such a way that alerts and notifications can be generated that allow a decision to be made.


# Specific Objetive

Analyze the different existing mechanisms for obtaining transmission quality information from a communications system. 
Analyze time series and explore statistical mechanisms for detection. 
Develop a tool that allows generating a report of failures detected in transmission and their correlation between nodes. 
Propose a self-healing solution on the network, through an automatic action on the communication links.
